# OWID-Covid-Data-Analysis
This project deals with COVID-19 data. After, some preprocessing, I have visualized the number of confirmed new cases for 2020 against the case fatality rate. Two graphs have been used to communicate the insights with the second one having the same parameters as the first with the exception of using log on the confirmed new cases to make it more readible. 

Dependencies used include pandas, matplotlib, sys, argparse.
